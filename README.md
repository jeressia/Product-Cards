# Product Cards
This is a webpage displaying product cards. My page is for a fictional store and I used flexbox to create a responsive webpage showing 3 cards per row on a desktop, 2 cards per row on a table, and one card per row on a mobile device. I also used advanced positioning to place a 'Sold Out' image on top of one of my images.
